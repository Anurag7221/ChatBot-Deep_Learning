# ChatBot-Deep_Learning
This is a simple Chatbot. I have used Python's Tensorflow and keras for creating my Deep neural network!
I have used different python libraries like numpy, scikit-learn, colorama, json, and pickle!
Run train.py to activate the BOT!

This is Just a simple BOT which answers general questions of Users.
If you want your bot do answers more questions then you just need to change Intents.json file in proper format!
#Njoy!!
