# ChatBot-Deep_Learning
Hi! ,there

This is a simple Chatbot. I have used Python's Tensorflow and keras for creating my Deep neural network!

I have used different python libraries like numpy[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/numpy-in-python-set-1-introduction/], scikit-learn[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/learning-model-building-scikit-learn-python-machine-learning-library/], colorama[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-colors-python-terminal/], json[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/working-with-json-data-in-python/], and pickle[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-python-pickling-example/]!

I have used Pycharm IDE [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/] for coding!

Run train.py to activate the BOT!

This is Just a simple BOT which answers general questions of Users.
If you want your bot do answers more questions then you just need to change Intents.json file in proper format!

#Njoy!!
